[HEADER]
VERSION=1
POWER_CURVE= 	; power curve file
COAST_CURVE= 	; coast curve. can define 3 different options (coast reference, coast values for mathematical curve, coast curve file)

[ENGINE_DATA]
ALTITUDE_SENSITIVITY= 	; sensitivity to altitude
INERTIA= 	; engine inertia
MINIMUM= 	; engine idle rpm
LIMITER= 	; engine rev limiter. 0 no limiter
LIMITER_HZ=20

[COAST_REF]
RPM= 	; rev number reference
TORQUE= 	; engine braking torque value in Nm at rev number reference
NON_LINEARITY= 	; coast engine brake from ZERO to TORQUE value at rpm with linear (0) to fully exponential (1)

[COAST_DATA]
COAST0= 	; 
COAST1=0
COAST=0.0000015

[COAST_CURVE]
FILENAME= 	; coasting curve file

[TURBO_0]
LAG_DN= 	; Interpolation lag used slowing down the turbo
LAG_UP= 	; Interpolation lag used to spin up the turbo
MAX_BOOST= 	; Maximum boost generated. This value is never exceeded and multiply the torque like T=T*(1.0 + boost), so a boost of 2 will give you 3 times the torque at a given rpm.
WASTEGATE= 	; Max level of boost before the wastegate does its things. 0 = no wastegate
DISPLAY_MAX_BOOST= 	; Value used by display apps
REFERENCE_RPM= 	; The reference rpm where the turbo reaches maximum boost (at max gas pedal). 
GAMMA=2.5
COCKPIT_ADJUSTABLE=0

[DAMAGE]
TURBO_BOOST_THRESHOLD= 	; level of TOTAL boost before the engine starts to take damage
TURBO_DAMAGE_K= 	; amount of damage per second per (boost - threshold)
RPM_THRESHOLD= 	; RPM at which the engine starts to take damage
RPM_DAMAGE_K= 	; amount of damage per second per (rpm-threshold)
